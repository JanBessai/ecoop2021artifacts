# Introduction

This Scala implementation applies CoCo to the SCANS case study, as presented
as a case study by W. Zhang, Y. Sun, and B. D. S. Oliveira, "Compositional
Programming" (ECOOP 2021), https://wxzh.github.io/papers/toplas2021.pdf

The branches in this presentation are numbered from m1, to more closely
align with the numberings scheme used by the above paper.

Tests M1Test and M5Test execute and pass. Not yet sure how meaningful they are!
